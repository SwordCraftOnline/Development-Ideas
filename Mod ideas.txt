Development-Ideas
=================

List all the ideas for the mod you have here
---------------------------------------------

Leave a description for the mod feature, so that we know how its going to work
(not in hierarchy)


- Safe zones - where players are safe from other player attacks - no pvp areas (towns, villages, parts in dungeons and 
boss room)

- skill trees - a separte hot bar above the default bar for skills (can only equip 6-9 skills (excludes weapons skills))
(The skills that can be equiped to the hotbar will only be offensive skills and healing skills - no sneak skills or 
hearing, etc like such)

- tiers for weapons (i.e kirito's sword (black one) tier 8, (blue one) tier 9) - (tier 1 - 15+) (Donator ranks may start 
with tier 2)

- Sword-Craft-Offline (This will be the single player base of the mod which will include much more features which can't be
on the server (like spawning villages))
